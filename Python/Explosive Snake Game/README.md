# Explosive Snake Game

### How to run
1. Download the ExplosiveSnakeGame.zip file
2. Extract the contents of the zip file
3. Navigate into the uncompressed file
4. Run the executable snake_game.py _(must be run from the directory it's located in)_

### Requirements
Need Python 3.x and pygame package installed. Must run the snake_game.py file from the directory it's located in.

### Notes
The contents of the "Explosive Snake Files" folder and ExplosiveSnakeGame.zip are identical. The former directory is 
provided so downloading the zip file is not necessary to view the work sample.

### How to play
Use keyboard arrow keys to keep the snake from crashing into the screen walls, brown boxes, and snake itself to avoid explosion _(gameover)_.
