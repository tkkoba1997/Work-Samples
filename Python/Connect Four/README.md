# README
The provided .py file implements "connect four", or "four-in-a-row" at the command line. Users enter in a 
number 1-7 (inclusive) and to place a marker at the bottome of that column. First player to get 4 
markers in a row horizontally, vetically, or diagonally, wins.

# Compatibility
Runs on Windows OS, but can be made to run on Linux and macOS by changing line 32 to use "clear" instead of "cls" in quotation marks.
